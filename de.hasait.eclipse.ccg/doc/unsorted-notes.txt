- properties should support simple aspects like beforewrite, afterwrite, beforeread
- PropertySync, Updater implement different and unify:
  - enhance Updater to allow navigation over one node (i.e. property of local property: local.foreign)
  - introduce target-spec and dirty-flag to Updater to allow lazy-calculation
  - PropertySync is special-case or higher-level pattern, which uses Updater
